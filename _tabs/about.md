Welcome to my personal website!

I’m Benjamin Börschlein, a graduate economist and a quantitative labor market researcher based in Germany. My passion for data analysis and processing drives my professional work, while my curiosity extends into IT infrastructure and data engineering, which I explore through maintaining a homelab.

When I’m not immersed in data or IT projects, I enjoy hands-on activities as a way to balance my time in front of a screen—whether it’s working on my motorcycles or converting a camper van.

This website serves as a personal knowledge hub, documenting what I’ve learned along the way. While it’s primarily for my own growth, I also hope it might prove useful to others, which is why I’ve chosen to make my projects public.
